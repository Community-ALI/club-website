### How to Contribute
1. Choose an issue to work on, and assign yourself that issue
2. Create a branch using the following format: initials-issue-number-short-description-of-branch
3. Use "next run dev" to see your changes as you work.  Make sure to commit often.
4. Create a pull request back into main. If your code does not pass all tests, try using "next run build" to figure out where the issue is.

### Your commit messages should be formatted as follows:

Short message example (`git commit -m "..."`):

`type(scope):subject`

Long message example (`git commit`):
```
type(scope):subject
(blank line)
body
```

`type`: Select one of the following 8 commit types. These are your _only_ options for commit type:

- **_feat_**: A new feature for the application user. Rolling out a new module, new piece of functionality, etc.
- **_fix_**: Bug fix to your production code. Dealing with GH Issues, fixing a bug, etc.
- **_docs_**: Changes to your documentation. Adding a comment, editing a comment, changing README.md files, etc.
- **_style_**: Changes to your code formatting. _This does **not** address CSS styling_ but rather the style of your code. Reformatting, adding semi-colons, etc.
- **_refactor_**: Refactor to production code. Upgrading a package and changing your code to meet the new demands, changing a **let** or a **const** name, etc.
- **_test_**: All things that apply to unit testing. Creating tests, refactoring tests, etc. No changes to production code occur.
- **_chore_**: Updating gulp, webpack, package.json files. This is developer-facing _only_.
- **_workaround_**: Temporary fix until a more robust solution is found or until other factors are resolved.

`scope`: Narrow the scope of the commit to a one or two word description in parentheses

`subject`: Favor imperative mood, present tense, active voice, and start with verbs. Don't use a period at the end. Think of it as a newspaper headline.
